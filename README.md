# dinosaur-cactus-google-chrome-game

In this repo you can find the clone of the popular Chrome game, which is available, when there is no internet connection.

# Usage: 

Fire up a terminal and write 

  "java -jar DinosaurCactus.jar [OBSTACLE_NUMBER]"
  
where OBSTACLE_NUMBER is the number of obstacles, that'll spawn in front of the dino. Default value is 10.

# PS:

To realize this, I used Java, SWING, as this was the assignment on my exam at the university.
